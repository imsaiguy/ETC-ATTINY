the PCB is available: https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/ATTINY_ETC_board_for_ETW_3800_Microprocessor_Trainer_3e4ca640.html
In order to program the ATTINY you will need to use the one-wire interface called UPDI. this one wire interface is avalable on the ETW-3800 signal COP, it is on the upper set next to last on the right.

The software has checked these functions:
control LEDD
LCD display
keyboard interface
four IO lines IO0 IO1 IO2 IO3
input port
output port
address bus
data bus input/output
